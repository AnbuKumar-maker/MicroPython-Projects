# import library to deal with pins:
from machine import Pin

# define pin 0 as output
led = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)

# define value of "led" as "1" or "True" to turn on the LED
led.value(1)

# define value of "led" as "0" or "False" to turn off the LED
led.value(0)

# also you can use .on() or .off methods to control the pin:
led.on()

led.off()

from time import sleep

for i in range(5):
    led.on()

    led.off()

# define pin 13 as an input and activate an internal Pull-up resistor:
button = Pin(13, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

# Read button state:
print(button.value())
